# Make a Morse Code Encoder with Arduino



Here we used Arduino UNO to translate a text to Morse code. Upload this code on your Arduino board and open your serial monitor window. Type your desired word or text and receive it in Morse code, then you can send it as light and sound

code to convert any word or charachter  to its morse code and display it at led
" the input take by the serial monitor " 
● short mark, ​dot​ or "dit" (·) : "dot duration" is one time unit long 
● longer mark, ​dash​ or "dah" (–) : three time units long
 ● inter-element gap​ between the dots and dashes within a character : one dot duration or one unit long 
● short gap​ (between letters) : three time units long
● medium gap​ (between words) : seven time units long
